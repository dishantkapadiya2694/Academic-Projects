;;;DATA DESIGN: no data design required
;;;
;;;distance-to-origin: Real Real->Pos Real
;;;GIVEN: 'x' and 'y' co-ordinates of the point 
;;;RETURNS: scaler positive distance to origin from the given point
;;;
;;;EXAMPLES: (distance-to-origin 3 4) = 5
;;;          (distance-to-origin -1.5 3.6) = 3.9
;;;          (distance-to-origin -4 -9.7) = #i10.4923
;;;          (distance-to-origin 5 -7) = #i8.6023
;;;
;;;DESIGN STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
;;;
;;;FUNCTION DESIGN :-
(define (distance-to-origin x y)
   (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))    ; Computes using distance formula of co-ordinate geometry
;;;
;;;TESTS:-
(check-expect (distance-to-origin 3 4) 5)
(check-expect (distance-to-origin -1.5 3.6) 3.9)
(check-within (distance-to-origin -4 -9.7) 10.4900 10.5000)
(check-within (distance-to-origin 5 -7) 8.6000 8.7000)
;;;
;;;PROGRAM REVIEW: the program computes distance to origin for points from every quadrant and provide relevent answers.
