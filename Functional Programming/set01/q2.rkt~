;;;DATA DESIGN: no data design required
;;;
;;;string-first: String -> 1String
;;;GIVEN: a string values
;;;RETURNS: a 1String extracted from string
;;;
;;;EXAMPLES: (string-first "Northeastern") = "N"
;;;          (string-first "\tUniversity") = "\t"
;;;          (string-first " Boston") = " "
;;;
;;;DESIGN STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
;;;
;;;FUNCTION DESIGN:-
(define (string-first str)
  (string-ith str 0)) ;characters like " ", "\t" , "\b", "\n", "\r" are interpreted as single character though it has 2 symbols. So, extracting character at 0th position works
;;;
;;;TESTS:-
(check-expect (string-first "Northeastern") "N")
(check-expect (string-first "\tUniversity") "\t")
(check-expect (string-first " Boston") " ")
;;;
;;;PROGRAM REVIEW: this program efficiently extracts the first character and returns it in form of 1String.
