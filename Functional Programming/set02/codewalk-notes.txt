Correctness: 13/15
Design: AB
Presentation: A

Notes:

- 100% code coverage
- Direction cannot be any string. Define separate data definition for direction.
- Also in the proble definition, x and y are only integers for the problem
- Do not added functionality not specified in the problem statement (error statements in probe-at) (Major)
- probe-at does not stick to the contract (returns a string when it says it returns a Probe)
- Indentation is incorrect for most of the functions
- probe-forward method could be simplified with the help of helper functions
- N,S,W,E are not good names for constants
