#**FOUNDATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**
### [*CS5100 - NEU - FALL 2015*](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rplatt/cs5100_2015/index.html)
***********
#DESCRIPTION
This course introduces to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence including the following topics:

1. Search
2. Decision making under uncertainty
3. Bayes Networks
4. Machine learning

For the assignments, students use the Pacman AI projects developed at UC Berkeley. Assignments are typically to implement the algorithms and make Pacman intelligent. Few assignments implement different agent than Pacman but the motive remains the same, make an intelligent agent.

#IMPLEMENTATION
Programming Language used throughout the course is Python. It is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.

#USAGE
Read "README.md" file attached to all the Assignment folders. Every assignment takes a different file into account, sometimes even multiple files. Essentially, we run a python program which may invoke a Tkinter GUI and user can see the output of code.
