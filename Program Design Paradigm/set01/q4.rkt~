;;;DATA DESIGN: no data design required
;;;
;;;string-insert: String Int -> String
;;;GIVEN: string and postion where '_' is to be added
;;;RETURNS: string with '_' inserted at desired position
;;;
;;;EXAMPLES: (string-insert "Northeastern" 5) = "North_eastern"
;;;          (string-insert "University" 0) = "_University"
;;;          (string-insert "Boston" 6) = "Boston_"
;;;          (string-insert "" 0) = "_"
;;;
;;;DESIGN STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
;;;
;;;FUNCTION DESIGN :-
(define (string-insert str i)
   (string-append (substring str 0 i) "_" (substring str i)));combine substring before ith character, '_' character and rest of the substring
;;;
;;;TESTS:-
(check-expect (string-insert "Northeastern" 5) "North_eastern")
(check-expect (string-insert "University" 0) "_University")
(check-expect (string-insert "Boston" 6) "Boston_")
(check-expect (string-insert "" 0) "_")
;;;
;;;PROGRAM REVIEW: This program can handle insert in empty string. We always assume that value of i is between 0 and length of the string. In case of empty string, it enters at 0.
